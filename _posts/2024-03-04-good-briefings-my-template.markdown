title: The value of good briefings - and a pragmatic template

The one lesson I've learned over two decades and a bit of project work: good briefings = good outcomes, bad briefings = bad outcomes/failure. It's not the only factor, but a massively important one. As no one wants bad outcomes (take it), it's surprising how many briefings fall short. Esp. as it can be avoided w/out much mental bandwidth. In this post, I've put together "my" template - hoping that it's useful.

First question I did ask myself is: "Why are details not enough?" Everyone living (or rather suffering) through a ticket-based workstyle can probably relate: sth is missing and that sth is *context*. There are a *thousand little micro-decisions* in every dev effort - and devs can get them right or wrong. I'd argue the odds for *right* improve quite dramatically with more context - i.e. a good briefing. A little more than 200 years ago, Clausewitz stressed aspects like *objective*, *will* and *friction* in [On War](https://www.icct.nl/sites/default/files/import/publication/On-War.pdf) (highly recommended read btw). And as "there was nothing new under the sun" (J. Mattis, [Call Sign Chaos](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46037714-call-sign-chaos) - another highly recommended read), every project *today* can benefit.

Yet at the same time, winging it rarely cuts it. And it takes up a lot of mental bandwith. 

So: here's my stab at a ***template*** to create briefings

- quickly (it's not about writing a PhD thesis!)
- in high quality (i.e. presentable)
- with little mental bandwith needed
- that are useful for everyone in the team along the way

You can be the the judge of whether I succeeded of course - I tried to condense some good reading into my take: 

- [Major Account Sales Strategy](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/796562-major-account-sales-strategy) by Neil Rackham - a great guide on finding objectives and helping in achieving them
- the Rational Unified Process - a template set (with many variations) that just helps in asking the right questions. You can find old(er) versions online by searching for "RUP templates"; there is also a [Summary on StackExchange](https://pm.stackexchange.com/questions/11710/rup-document-templates).
- Code Complete and the Software Project Survivial Guide by [Steve McConnell](https://stevemcconnell.com/books/)
- agile practices that work
- the concept of Customer Journey (or Employee Journey or any journey, really)
- [The Silo Effect](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25111105-the-silo-effect) by Gillian Tett (Editor at the FT) on the importance of connecting the dots
- Amazon's policy on *written* briefings - see e.g. in [this video](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastian-rothbucher-2a909126_instead-of-powerpoint-presentations-at-amazon-activity-7154132657155506176-gTti?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
- and many, *many* more (a reading list would be a separate topic, really)

## The template

Anyhow: here's my take as in a template to fill by asking important questions: 

### Get a lay of the land

#### Describe the current Situation

#### Describe what's not OK with it

#### Describe the consequence of not acting

### First possible solution

#### Quick summary of the solution

#### Steps the user / costomer goes through (journey; bullets / chevron diagram)

#### Concrete walkthrough (no generic terms, name customers and products)

#### Implementation details

### Second possible solution

#### Quick summary of the solution

#### Steps the user / costomer goes through (journey; bullets / chevron diagram)

#### Concrete walkthrough (no generic terms, name customers and products)

#### Implementation details

### Next steps

#### Decision - which alternative do we chose

#### Affected use cases

#### Affected components in our system

#### Affected systems outside our control

#### Next steps from here

(that's it)

## Some notes on usage

The most important part is the ***first*** part (Getting a lay of the land) - and that should not take longer than 10 minutes. If you only have 10 minutes, that's the one. Still, spending some more time (an hour tops) on laying out the solution proved powerful to me. All-in-all, even with little time involved, you might get a lot more clarity for everyone. Plus: it's time you don't have to spend explaining over and over again. 

## Wrap-up

As ever: I hope this helps you a little and you found this useful. Sure lmk what you think!
