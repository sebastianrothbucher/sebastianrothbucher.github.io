I created a series of posts about how and why Event Driven Architecture (EDA) can help modernize applications and get new services out of the door. Also about how to get started for real on AWS and focusing on the right things. Find out more below.

## Part 1: Why go Iterative?

Let's face a hard truth: legacy applications are becoming increasingly expensive to maintain while making it harder to innovate and stay competitive. Sound familiar? Yet, there's a way out: modernize to monetize. One approach pretty much came out on top over many projects in many industries over many years: Event Driven Architecture (EDA).

## Part 2: The Event-Driven Approach

When modernizing applications, taking a block-by-block approach makes the most sense. But how do we effectively separate these blocks while maintaining communication between them? This is where Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) shines.

## Part 3: Getting Started

Let's talk practical steps in modernizing applications with Event-Driven Architecture (EDA). The journey typically involves two main phases: introducing EDA and then gradually modernizing components.

## Part 4: Leverage AWS and really get going

At some point, the rubber needs to hit the road: this article dives into the details on how to actually implement EDA on AWS using native services: getting results quickly while using the cloud as oneâ€™s workhorse. And yes, it's opinionated.
