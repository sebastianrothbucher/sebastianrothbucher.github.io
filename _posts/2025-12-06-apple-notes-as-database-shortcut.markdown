However, there is a way, at least for a small number of records, that we all have on our computers and in our pockets already (as long as that's a Mac or iPhone): the Notes app. It works great on mobile, one can share a single note or a folder with others, it replicates between devices, has tagging & checklists, and it's paid for with the device.
