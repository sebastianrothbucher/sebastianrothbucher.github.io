Hi, I'm Sebastian, a Frontend-focused Web Developer with a boutique consultancy in Hamburg, Germany (all opinions my own). I've dived into many interesting subjects: making sense of data and creating apps that allow people to make a difference and provide great service. This involves a lot of JavaScript (esp. React, D3), CSS and friends plus visualization and databases.
