Hi, I'm Sebastian, a Web Developer with a boutique consultancy in Hamburg, Germany (all opinions my own). I've dived into many interesting subjects: making sense of data and creating apps that allow people to make a difference at work. This involves both JavaScript and Data Science - what is Blog is about.

I'm always curious about things, incl. your thoughts. Feel free to drop me a note at sebastianrothbucher@googlemail.com
