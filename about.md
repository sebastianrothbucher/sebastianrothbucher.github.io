Hi, I'm Sebastian. I've dived into many interesting subjects: making sense of data and creating apps that allow people to make a difference and provide great service. This involves a lot of JavaScript plus data science, visualization and databases.

Feel free to get in touch - drop me a note at sebastianrothbucher@googlemail.com
